NOTE: Test json file need to be set to copy to CopyToOutputDirectory or they won't be found by the loader at test time. 
See the FunWithQuadTrees.Testing.csproj or file properties in the IDE for this setting if adding more json files.
At time of writing this was already set for ExpectedDataSet.json and InputDataSet.json.
